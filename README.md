🛒 E-Commerce Order System
A real-time, full-stack bridge between customer experience and backend management.

This platform isn't just a shop; it’s a synchronized ecosystem. By utilizing a unified database architecture, the system ensures that the moment a customer clicks "Place Order," the administrative dashboard reflects the transaction—no refreshes required.

🚀 Key Features
👤 User Storefront

Live Dashboard: A "mission control" center that monitors incoming orders with instant data synchronization.

⚙️ Technical Architecture: The Sync Logic
The core of this application is its Unified Synchronization Engine. Unlike traditional systems that rely on frequent polling, this project uses a shared data layer to maintain a "Single Source of Truth."

How it works: When an order is finalized, the backend triggers a database event that is immediately broadcasted to the Admin UI. This eliminates the gap between customer action and business reaction.
